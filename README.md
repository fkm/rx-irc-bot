# @rx-irc/bot - ReactiveX IRC bot (RxBot)
A Node.js IRC bot framework based on RxJS streams.

## Abstract
As "eggdrop" is aging and TCL is vanishing into obsurity, I wanted a modern platform written in Javascript. I needed something modular and easy to configure and maintain. RxBot runs on Node and uses RxJS to handle the stream of data comming from the IRC network. Modules are configured in the main package and installed through NPM dependencies, which eliminates most conflicts during updates. The system is still in its early stages but has already shown promise in scalability since its inception as a trivia bot.
